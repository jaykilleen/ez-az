# ADR Index

Topic-tagged map of all ADRs. Read this **before any non-trivial task** to
find which decisions are already made.

Newer ADRs carry `Triggers:` and `Topics:` near the top -- grep for them when
in doubt: `grep -l "Triggers:.*tv" docs/decisions/*.md`. Older ADRs predate
that convention and don't have them yet; they pick it up if they're touched.

## How to use

1. Identify the area of the task (TV/Zone, player identity, a specific game, deploys, design system).
2. Look up the topic below to see which ADRs are relevant.
3. Read the relevant ADRs **before** writing code, advising, or making a decision in that area.
4. If the task spans topics, read all relevant ADRs.
5. If no ADR covers the area but the decision is significant, use `/adr` to draft a new one.

## Maintenance

When adding a new ADR:
1. Use the next number in sequence (currently next: **015**)
2. Add `Triggers:` and `Topics:` near the top
3. Add a row to the chronological table above
4. Add the ADR number to relevant topic rows above
5. Cross-reference older ADRs in `## Related` if applicable
